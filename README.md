The objective of our research project is to investigate what factors contribute to depression in
students. Specifically, our research topic revolves around the central question: How accurately
can we predict students at risk of depression? What are the contributing factors to that risk? The
formation of our questions hinged on five main criteria:
● Specificity: Our dataset includes specific target variables such as sleep duration, eating
habits, stress levels and family medical history.
● Measurability: Our dataset includes two potential target variables with binary categories
that will enable measurement of our target of interest (depression and if they have ever
had suicidal thoughts).
● Achievability: The scope and specificity of our variables will allow us to answer our
research question from several angles.
● Relevance: This study will be relevant to our audience of our graduate student peers, who
may be struggling with their own mental health or know others who are.
● Time-Oriented: Our dataset is clean and well organized, which will help us complete our
analysis in a timely manner.

To answer our questions, our team will utilize a Kaggle data set that includes information on
students’ lifestyle as well as feelings of pressure and satisfaction in their academic and
professional lives. In this data set, there are 141, 000 observations with each observation
equating to a student’s record.
